# Muni

> Two ravens named Huginn and **Muninn** sit on Odin's shoulders. Odin sends Huginn and Muninn out at dawn, and the birds fly all over the world before returning at dinner-time. These ravens flew all over the land and brought him information, causing Odin to become **"very wise in his lore"**.
